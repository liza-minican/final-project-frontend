Final Project Frontend: Online Yoga Studio

This project is an online yoga studio with functioning Sign Up, Sign In modules.
When you go to videos you can see a video collection, you can filter videos by category, in the future filtering by length will be added.
If you are Signed In you can add or remove videos to/from your favorites.
You can also access your favorite videos directly when you are Signed In.
All the videos were posted through Postman using endpoints provided by the backend of the project. In the future there will be an admin panel where you could post/delete/update videos if you have admin rights.
